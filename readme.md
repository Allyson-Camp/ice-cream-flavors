project plan: 
- Users can input ice cream flavors into a form. 
- We will then use a for loop to manipulate said user form 
- and print it to the webpage.
- make sure it does not repeat/clears previous submissions

tests/functions needed: 

Describe: renderFlava() 

Test #1: it will return a string if the user inputs a string
Code: let userString ='hi';
renderFlava("userString");
Expected Output: 'hi'
